# Day Management

- [ ] Copy current day to another day.
- [ ] Mark day as completed.
- [ ] Favorite a day (highlight in the calendar).

## What needs to be done

### 1. Logic Implementation

- [ ] **Copy Day**: Create a server-side action to duplicate all logs from `date_a` to `date_b`.
- [ ] **Mark Completed**: Add a `status` field to the daily summary to track completion.

### 2. Calendar Enhancements

- [ ] Update the calendar UI to show checkmarks for completed days.
- [ ] Add a "Star" icon or special background color for favorited days.

### 3. UX Features

- [ ] Add a "Actions" menu to the daily log view for these new commands.
